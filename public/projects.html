                Version 1 of Wordle was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Version 2 was elevated by incorporating PHP through the usage of AJAX calls. Thus allowing for partial screen updates to occur.<br>
                Similar to the New York Times Wordle game, the player is given 6 chances to guess the correct five-letter word.
